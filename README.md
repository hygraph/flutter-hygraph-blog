# Basic blog app using Hygraph and Flutter

A modified version of: [Guided tutorial on how to use GraphQL with Flutter](https://hygraph.com/blog/flutter-graphql#graphql-in-flutter)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Hygraph project: [Blog app](https://app.hygraph.com/clone/ddebd4bb62d042c1b9e85e75e9708fcf?name=Blog%20App%20-%20Flutter%20Implementation%20Guide) 
2. Clone the repo: `npx degit https://github.com/hygraph/flutter-hygraph-blog.git`
3. Navigate to the root of your project by entering:  `cd flutter-hygraph-blog`
4. Replace the placeholder Hygraph content API URL:`https://<HYGRAPH_CDN_LOCATION>.cdn.hygraph.com/content/<ID>/master` in the `lib/main.dart` file with the endpoint URL from your cloned Hygraph project.
5. Start your flutter app
`flutter run`

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application using content from Hygraph.
